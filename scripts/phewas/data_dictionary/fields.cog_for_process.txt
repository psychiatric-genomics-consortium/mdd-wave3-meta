The outer array was zero-indexed, so that a value of 0 in this field means that the first symbol-digit array was used for the Coding array.   To illustrate, suppose a participant was allocated the value 5 for their start array. Then round 1 would use Array 5 [values 3,5,2,0,4,6,1,7] for the Code and Array 6 [6,3,7,2,4,5,0,1] for the Test. Round 2 would still use Array 5 for the Code but Array 7 [1,4,5,6,0,7,2,3] for the test etc.  The test arrays are listed below, and also in ~C500~ with the symbol dictionary shown in ~R111~.   0) 5,0,3,6,1,2,4,7   1) 1,3,5,7,4,6,0,2   2) 4,5,6,7,3,0,2,1   3) 1,4,6,7,2,3,0,5   4) 4,5,1,3,7,2,6,0   5) 3,5,2,0,4,6,1,7   6) 6,3,7,2,4,5,0,1   7) 1,4,5,6,0,7,2,3   8) 3,4,2,5,6,0,7,1   9) 2,5,3,0,7,1,6,4   10) 3,6,4,1,0,5,7,2   11) 5,3,2,0,4,1,7,6   12) 2,3,4,1,7,5,0,6   13) 4,3,1,5,2,0,6,7   14) 3,5,0,1,4,7,2,6   15) 4,2,1,0,6,7,5,3   16) 0,2,3,7,1,4,6,5   17) 7,1,2,4,0,6,5,3   18) 5,1,7,3,2,4,0,6   19) 7,6,4,5,0,2,3,1   20) 2,6,1,4,5,7,0,3   21) 4,0,6,1,3,7,5,2   22) 5,6,0,7,3,2,1,4   23) 6,5,1,3,0,4,7,2   24) 4,1,7,2,5,6,3,0   25) 5,2,0,6,7,4,1,3   26) 3,0,5,6,7,2,4,1   27) 3,2,5,4,7,0,6,1   28) 0,6,7,5,1,2,3,4   29) 4,3,1,0,6,5,2,7   30) 5,4,6,7,1,0,2,3   31) 0,4,7,2,3,1,5,6   32) 2,0,1,5,6,7,4,3  The first round (attempts 0-7) used a constant fixed pattern [2,4,6,1,3,5,7,0] for the Code Array and [7,1,5,4,6,0,3,2] for the test Array for all participants."
