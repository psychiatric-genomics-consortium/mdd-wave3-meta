# Plan

The TWAS field is developing constantly, with new software and reference data being released regularly. My recommendations are broadly consistent with our recent MDD TWAS using Wray et al sumstats. A preprint is [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.004903v1), and a more recent version can be sent upon request.

I would suggest the following we perform the TWAS using [FUSION](http://gusevlab.org/projects/fusion/) software and a range of SNP-weight sets derived from brain, HPA and HPT axis tissues and blood. Although Blood is unlikely to be causal it can act as a proxy for other tissues but results should interpreted carefully. For brain tissues we can use PsychENCODE, CommonMind consoritium and GTEx references. Although CommonMind is within PsychENCODE, PsychENCODE SNP-weights were derived in a slightly different way to CommonMind which means I think they are both useful. For HPA and HPT axis tissues we can use GTEx data. And for Blood tissue we can use the Young Finns Study, Netherlands Twin registry and GTEx. Except PsychENCODE, all these SNP-weights were derived by FUSION authors and are avialable on the FUSION website. PsychENCODE SNP-weights are from the [PsychENCODE](http://resource.psychencode.org/) website which I have downloaded and formatted as required already.

I would suggest using a permutation procedure to estimate the study-specific transcriptome-wide significance threshold. This approach is similar to how genome-wide significance was calculated. More information in supplement of my ASD TWAS paper [more info](https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(19)31334-4/abstract). It accounts for the correlation between nearby genes within the same SNP-weight set (e.g. PsychENCODE), and it accounts for the correlation between features representing the same gene across SNP-weight sets (e.g. NEGR1 GTEx, NEGR1 PsychENCODE). The alternative is Bonferroni correction which is highly conservative by assuming all features are independent.

An important part of TWAS is distinguishing linkage from pleiotropy as this helps to confirm that gene expression differences will really occur in the depression cases. Colocalisation is the main approach used for this, and is performed within the FUSION software using the [coloc](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004383) package. A limitation of this method is that it assumes a single causal variant underlies the association with both outcomes, which is inconsistent with the idea of TWAS which gains power by considering multiple eQTL effects for each gene. Another useful analysis to confirm pleiotropy, is software called [FOCUS](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0367-1). FOCUS performs statistical finemapping of TWAS associations, providing PIP estimates of causality, and 90% credible sets. This analysis helps identify TWAS associations that colocalise with the GWAS phenotype (same causal variant) and helps idenitfy which gene/s are most likely causal within a locus. This is useful as there are often peaks of genes associated in TWAS, and sometime multiple genes colocalise.

People often want to test for gene-set enrichment withint he TWAS results. In the past I have used software that I wrote called [TWAS-GSEA](https://github.com/opain/TWAS-GSEA/blob/master/TWAS-GSEA.V1.2.R), which is similar to MAGMA in that it tests for enrichment using a linear mixed model with a gene-gene correlation matrix to account for the non-independence of nearby genes due to LD. However, a new method has been released called [MESC](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0625-2) which I think is better as it distinguishes phenotypic variance mediated by cis-regulated expression, as opposed to linkage or pleitropy. Furthermore, this approach allows estimation of total phenotypic variance mediated by cis-regulated expression which may be of interest.

Lastly, it is nice to compare TWAS results with results from observed gene expression. We can do this using the largest depression gene expression study to date by [Jansen et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26008736/) using the netherlands twin registry.

Apart from MESC, I have performed all of the above analyses before and interpreted the results.

# Methods 

***

## Estimating Transcriptome-wide Significance

```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
sig_thresh<-1.368572e-06
```

This study uses the same SNP-weights of gene expression as our previous MDD TWAS (Dall'Aglio et al. 2020, Bio. Psych.). We will use the same transcriptome-wide significance threshold as this previous study (p=`r sig_thresh`), estimated using a permutation based procedure, similar to that used to estimate the genome-wide significance threshold (Dudbridge et al. 2008. Genet. Epidemiol.). The code used by Dall'Aglio et al. can be found [here](https://opain.github.io/MDD-TWAS/MDD_TWAS.html#1_estimating_transcriptome-wide_significance_threshold).


***

## TWAS

We will perform a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) using the software called FUSION (Gusev et al. 2016, Nat. Genet.). This method integrate genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics with SNP-based predictors (a.k.a. SNP-weights) of gene expression to infer differential gene expression associations with the GWAS phenotype. FUSION also performs colocalisation analysis using the coloc R package.

***

### GWAS sumstat preparation

The GWAS summary statistics were munged using the FOCUS software using default settings, using the effective sample size (Neff_half) as the sample size (N) column.

### SNP-weights of gene expression

In accordance with Dall'Aglio et al., we included SNP-weights of gene expression derived from tissues implicated in the aetiology of MDD, including brain tissues, HPA-axis tissues and HPT-axis tissues. In addition, we included blood based SNP-weights to act as a proxy for disease relvent tissues as sample sizes for blood expression are typically larger and cis-eQTL are moderately correlated between tissues (GTEx Consortium, 2017, Nature). SNP weights were downloaded via the TWAS FUSION website (http://gusevlab.org/projects/fusion/#reference-functional-data) after selection based on previous literature.

The weights pertained to the following 5 RNA reference samples: NTR (Netherlands Twin Register) and YFS (Young Finns Study), both of which provide information on blood tissue gene expression; CMC (CommonMind Consortium) and PsychENCODE Consortium, both of which assessed the DLPFC; and the GTEx Consortium, a state-of-the-art study in which expression in multiple brain and peripheral tissues was measured, although in a limited number of individuals (determining fewer heritable genes). The SNP-weights obtained from a given sample and tissue (e.g., GTEx thyroid, NTR peripheral blood) are called SNP-weight sets. Each gene within a given SNP-weight set is a feature, i.e., a gene that was examined within a given tissue and sample (e.g., NEGR1 GTEx thyroid).

### LD reference

The 1000 Genomes Phase 3 European LD reference with MAF >1% (N = 503) was used as an LD reference. We did not use the FUSION provided LD reference (also 1KG Phase 3) as it is restricted to HapMap3 variants, and although GTEx, CMC, NTR, YFS SNP-weights are restricted to HapMap3 variants, the PsychENCODE SNP-weights are not.
